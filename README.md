What I learned: 
This project allowed me to strenghthen my understanding of the DOM model and to familiarize myself with different DOM manipulation methods in Javascript. I ran into some roadblocks while implementing some of the interactive elements as I wasn't seeing expected results with different test cases. After a good's night's rest and some diffuse thinking, I was able to put together work-arounds for those roadblocks.
